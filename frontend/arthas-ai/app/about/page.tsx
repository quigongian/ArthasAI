              {`Since the 1990s, search engines have revolutionized access to
              information. Yet, three decades on, their fundamental mechanics
              have scarcely evolved. With Arthas AI, we're pioneering a search
              engine that transcends traditional keyword searches. Our tool
              makes finding information faster and easier by understanding what
              you're really looking for. This means less time spent searching
              and more time doing what matters. Our aim is to make research
              simpler and more efficient than ever before, moving beyond what
              traditional search engines offer.`}
